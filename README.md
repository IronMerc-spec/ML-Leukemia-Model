Tutorials for ML model largely from Better Data Science's Computer Vision Course on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@BetterDataScience
Dataset is from kaggle.com, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/obulisainaren/multi-cancer.

This project is largely a self-directed project where I developed a computer vision model from scratch given the data I found on the internet. I went through the exploratory data analysis, 
and learnt how to develop a computer vision model as I was working on this project. I experimented with various optimizers, loss functions, and pre-trained datasets to improve the model
to it's current state.
